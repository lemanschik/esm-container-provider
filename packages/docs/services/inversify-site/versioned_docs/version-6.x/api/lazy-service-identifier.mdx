# LazyServiceIdentifier

## Overview

The `LazyServiceIdentifier` class is a utility that delays the resolution of service identifiers until they're actually needed during dependency injection. Its primary purpose is to prevent accessing class service identifiers before they're fully initialized.

## Problem: Accessing Class Service Identifiers Prematurely

In TypeScript/JavaScript applications, when you directly reference a class as a service identifier before the class is fully defined, you might encounter initialization issues:

```typescript
// ServiceModule.ts
import { injectable, inject } from 'inversify';

@injectable()
export class Service {
  // Potential issue - Service class used before fully defined
  constructor(@inject(AnotherService) private dependency: AnotherService) {}
}

class AnotherService {
  // Implementation
}
```

This can lead to several issues:

1. TypeScript errors about using variables before they're declared
2. Runtime errors as the class might not be fully initialized when used as a service identifier

## Solution: LazyServiceIdentifier

`LazyServiceIdentifier` solves this problem by deferring the service identifier resolution until the injection process actually requires it:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{lazyServiceIdentifierSource}</CodeBlock>

## API Reference

### Constructor

```typescript
constructor(buildServiceId: () => ServiceIdentifier<TInstance>)
```

- `buildServiceId`: A function that returns a `ServiceIdentifier`. This function is called only when the service identifier is actually needed.

### Methods

#### unwrap(): ServiceIdentifier\<TInstance>

Returns the resolved service identifier by calling the function provided in the constructor.

#### static is\<TInstance>(value: unknown): value is LazyServiceIdentifier\<TInstance>

Checks if a value is an instance of `LazyServiceIdentifier`.
